First we specify truck characteristics in one line: Number of trucks, capacity, cost per distance, fixcost.
Then we specify city freighter characteristics: Max. number of city freighters per satellite, total number of city freighters available, capacity, cost per distance, fixed cost, maximum charging level, energy consumption per distance
Then we define depot and satellites in one line: x,y coordinates of the depot 
Then all x,y coordinates, handling cost per unit, maximum capacity, fixed cost of the satellites.
Then we define all the customers in one line: x,y,demand.
Finally we set the locations for the charging stations. Note that the coordinates of the satellites are doubled also here, as we assume that every satellite also serves as a charging station, plus some additional locations of course.

All distances are calculated as Euclidean and rounded to the nearest integer value. To reduce the effect of rounding, all x-and y-coordinates from the classical2EVRP instances have been multiplied by a factor ten.
